== Summary ==
phpArmory is a PHP class library that can easily fetch and unserialize World
of Warcraft Armory XML data into structured associative arrays.

This class library requires the PHP extensions for CURL, MySQL, and XML to
be available. Please make sure that these extensions are installed on your
server.

== Usage ==
Include phpArmory.class.php as the base class in your project, and inherit
new classes from the phpArmory class.

If you need caching of the retrieved XML results, include the caching class
from phpArmoryCache.class.php in your project, and inherit new classes from
the phpArmoryCache class.
