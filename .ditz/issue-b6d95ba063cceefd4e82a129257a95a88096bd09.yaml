    Currently the armory can be searched for arena teams, characters, items,
    and guilds, or for all object types.
    Allowed object filters are "arenateams", "characters", "items", and
    "guilds". Additionally a query for any object type may be done using a
    filter of "all".

    Implement function as getAnydata($searchType = NULL, $objectName = NULL,
    $filter = NULL).
    
    Note that searches for $searchType of 'all' will be returned paged, thus
    single queries for each data type have to be sent.
