0.3.0 - Apr 30, 2008
Mostly bug fixes, a few new features.

== Features added ==
* Language support. You now can define and query the language, in which you
  want to query data from the World of Warcraft armory.
* Region support. You now can define a regions' armory to query data from it.
  This is especially helpful, if querying character data from different
  regions (e.g. US and EU characters).

== Bugs Squashed ==
* The xmlToArray method was not properly checking, if children of the XML
  objects are proper arrays.
* Caching XML data retrieved from the World of Warcraft armory works again.
* MySQL query results will now be stored correct. The cacheSave() method was
  not checking, if an XML result was already stored in the database, and thus
  produced a duplicate key error. Now existing XML results will be updated
  instead of inserted.
