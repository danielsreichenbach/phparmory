# 0.4.0 - “Jack-o’-Lantern” - ??? ??, 2008

phpArmory has been rewritten for PHP5 and the new OOP class syntax. The class
interfaces have been changed to use getFunction() and setFunction() syntax,
and class variables have been adjusted to use private, protected, and public
states. Please consult the doc/ folder for updated API documentation.

## Bugs squashed

* 

## Features added

* phpArmory5 and phpArmory5Cache will now make use of trigger_error provided by
  PHP5 to raise notices (E_USER_NOTICE), warnings (E_USER_WARNING), and errors
  (E_USER_ERROR).

## Features changed

# 0.3.2 - “Giddyup!” - Oct 02, 2008

A pure bugfix release.

## Bugs squashed

* phpArmory.class.php: Class will not be instantiated if the Curl or XML
  extension is missing from your PHP installation.
* examples/character.php: Updated to use setArea. Properly dumps character data
  as XML. Please note that characterFetch() will now return the armory
  patchlevel, too.
* examples/guildroster.php: Updated to use setArea. Properly dumps the full
  guild roster as plain table.

# 0.3.1 - “Unknown item” - Sep 28, 2008

A few features have been revised, a few new ones added.

## Features added

* Patchlevel detection: getCurrentPatchlevel() will return the current patch
  version for the armory region you use.
* Talent definitions: TalentDefinitionFetch() will retrieve talent definition
  for all classes from the World of Warcraft website.
* WoW armory lockout prevention: with previous phpArmory versions, it could
  happen that your applications would be temporarily locked out from the
  armory. To prevent this, you can now limit the number of retries for XML
  pulling. To do this inherit your own classes like this:
  
  <?php
  $armoryFetch = new phpArmory ($armory = "http://www.wowarmory.com/", retries = 3);
  ?>

## Features changed

* Armory region and locales: this has been simplified, to only supply a setArea
  function to define which armory region we use.

# 0.3.0 - “Use soulstone” - Apr 30, 2008

Mostly bug fixes, a few new features.

## Features added

* Language support. You now can define and query the language, in which you
  want to query data from the World of Warcraft armory.
* Region support. You now can define a regions' armory to query data from it.
  This is especially helpful, if querying character data from different regions
  (e.g. US and EU characters).

## Bugs squashed

* The xmlToArray method was not properly checking, if children of the XML
  objects are proper arrays.
* Caching XML data retrieved from the World of Warcraft armory works again.
* MySQL query results will now be stored correct. The cacheSave() method was
  not checking, if an XML result was already stored in the database, and thus
  produced a duplicate key error. Now existing XML results will be updated
  instead of inserted.
